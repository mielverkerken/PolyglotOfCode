# Polyglot of Code

Here are my solutions for the [2021 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021 ), using a different programming language each day!

## What is Advent of Code?

_Advent of Code_ is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). People use them as a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard), [interview](https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/)  [prep](https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497), [company training](https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137), [university](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home)  [coursework](https://www.gribblelab.org/scicomp2021/), [practice](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584)  [problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

I used it to challenge myself to solve each daily problem in a different programming language, most of which I never used before. This proved to be hard but interesting experience.

Inspiration for the used programming languages is taken from the [_StackOverflow 2021 Developer Survey_](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies).
